# BNB Portfolio Manager - Application Architecture & Requirements

**PURPOSE**: This is a living, centralised document that captures the vision, intent, and evolving implementation of the BNB Portfolio Manager. This document is designed for development team reference and contains the complete context including requirements, philosophy, technical decisions, lessons learned, and critical implementation details that must not be forgotten.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE**: Always read relevant sections of this document before making changes to any component. This document contains the complete context that otherwise gets lost, including user requirements, design decisions, and debugging lessons. Update this document as the application evolves, but preserve historical context where relevant.

---

## 1. APPLICATION OVERVIEW

### Core Philosophy
- **Portfolio-First Navigation Paradigm**: The application is built around the principle that users always work within a specific portfolio context. No transaction or stock operations exist in isolation.
- **Kimball Star Schema Architecture**: All data is structured using dimensional modeling principles for optimal analytics performance.
- **User-Controlled Data Quality**: Users maintain complete control over data verification and market assignments, with the system providing intelligent assistance rather than making automatic decisions.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript, CSS Variables for theming
- **Backend**: Flask + SQLAlchemy ORM, Python 3.12
- **Database**: SQLite with Kimball Star Schema design
- **External APIs**: Yahoo Finance for market data and stock verification
- **Architecture**: REST API with staged ETL processing

## 2. TRANSACTION IMPORT WORKFLOW - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS

### The Revolutionary Approach  
**CRITICAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**: The user emphasized starting fresh rather than being constrained by existing code:
1. Understand complete requirements first
2. Design optimal solution architecture  
3. Assess if existing code meets requirements
4. Remove and restart components that don't align
5. **NO PREMATURE ABSTRACTION** - build exactly what's needed

### Complete 5-Step Workflow (EXACT USER REQUIREMENTS)

#### Step 1: File Upload & Column Mapping + Date Format Selection
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING
- **Purpose**: Establish data structure and format configuration
- **Process**:
  - User uploads CSV/Excel file
  - System detects column structure and suggests mappings  
  - User confirms/adjusts column mappings to required fields
  - **CRITICAL**: User selects date format (moved from validation step)
  - All configuration completed in single step
- **Required Fields**: Date, Instrument Code, Transaction Type, Quantity, Price, Total Value (optional)
- **Files**: `ColumnMapping.tsx`, `FileUpload.tsx`
- **Database Impact**: None (file analysis only)

#### Step 2: Map Columns (Already Handled in Step 1)
- **Note**: Combined with Step 1 for efficiency

#### Step 3: Confirm Transactions (CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY)
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING
- **CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY**: Must use "Confirm Transactions" - NOT "verify"
- **"Verify" is reserved EXCLUSIVELY for Yahoo Finance API calls**
- **ZERO external API calls during this step**

**User Interface Requirements**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Full confirmation screen** (not popup)
- **Summary Display**:
  1. **File**: Filename (displayed in title)
  2. **Total Rows**: Total transactions in file
  3. **New Stocks**: Unique stocks not in portfolio 
  4. **New Transactions**: Non-duplicate transactions
  5. **View Details**: Expandable transaction breakdown per stock in separate tile
     - Shows only BUY/SELL transactions (DIVIDEND/SPLIT removed as requested)
     - Styled with centered colored toggle button

**User Actions**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **"Confirm Transactions" button**: Centered below tiles, proceeds to Step 4
- **"Go Back" button**: Styled as underlined link, returns to column mapping
- **Column mapping summary**: Horizontal layout to save vertical space
- **NO auto-advancement**: User must explicitly confirm

**Database Flow**:
```
User Confirmation → STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS (with import_batch_id)
├── processed_flag = FALSE  
├── validation_errors = NULL (if valid) or error details
└── Data staged but NOT processed into fact tables yet
```

**API**: `POST /api/import/validate` → Enhanced validation with summary + transaction breakdown
**Files**: `DataPreview.tsx` ✅ COMPLETED - All UI fixes implemented

#### Step 4: Verify Stocks (Market Assignment & Lightweight Verification)
- **Status**: 🔄 NEEDS COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION  
- **Purpose**: Assign market codes to construct proper Yahoo Finance symbols + lightweight verification
- **CRITICAL**: Only triggers for NEW stocks not already in portfolio

**The Market Code Problem**:
- Raw data contains: "AFI" (just the ticker)
- Yahoo Finance requires: "AFI.AX" (ticker + market suffix)
- User must select market to construct proper Yahoo symbol

**Table Interface Requirements**:

| Column | Purpose | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Ticker** | Raw instrument code from data | Display only (e.g., "AFI") |
| **Market** | User-selectable dropdown | 87 Yahoo market codes available |
| **Yahoo Symbol** | Auto-constructed symbol | Updates immediately when market selected (e.g., "AFI.AX") |
| **Stock Name** | Retrieved from Yahoo | Blank initially, populated after verification |
| **Currency** | Retrieved from Yahoo | Blank initially, populated after verification |
| **DRP** | Dividend Reinvestment Plan flag | User can enable for this portfolio |
| **Status** | Verification status | Delisted/Verified/Pending/Failed |
| **Actions** | Action menu dropdown | Manual verify, corporate actions, mark delisted |

**Status Field Values**:
- **Pending**: Not yet verified OR market assignment changed and needs re-verification
- **Verified**: Successfully retrieved data from Yahoo Finance  
- **Failed**: Attempted verification but Yahoo Finance returned error
- **Delisted**: User-marked as delisted (skip verification)

**Verification Process (Lightweight)**:
- **PURPOSE**: Prove Yahoo symbol is valid endpoint
- **RETRIEVES**: Stock name and currency ONLY
- **NO HISTORICAL DATA** retrieval at this stage
- **API Call**: `MarketDataService.verify_stock_lightweight(yahoo_symbol)`

**User Workflow**:
1. Table shows all new stocks requiring market assignment
2. User selects market from dropdown for each stock
3. Yahoo symbol auto-updates (ticker + market_suffix)
4. User can trigger verification for individual stocks or batch
5. Verification populates stock name/currency if successful
6. User can mark stocks as delisted to skip verification
7. User can set DRP flags for portfolio-specific settings
8. **Proceed button**: Only enabled when satisfied with verified stocks

**Database Flow**:
```
New Stocks → DIM_STOCK (created with pending status)
├── instrument_code: "AFI"  
├── yahoo_symbol: "AFI.AX" (after market assignment)
├── market_key: Foreign key to DIM_YAHOO_MARKET_CODES
├── verification_status: 'pending'/'verified'/'failed'/'delisted'
├── name: NULL initially, populated after verification
└── currency: NULL initially, populated after verification

Portfolio Settings → PORTFOLIO_STOCK_CONFIG  
├── drp_enabled: User-set DRP flag
└── notes: User notes if any
```

**APIs**:
- `GET /api/import/markets` → Returns all 87 market codes
- `POST /api/import/assign-markets` → Assigns markets and verifies stocks
- `POST /api/stocks/verify-lightweight` → Individual stock verification

**Files**: `StockVerification.tsx` (needs creation), `MarketDataService.verify_stock_lightweight()`

#### Step 5: Import Transactions (Historical Data + Fact Table Processing)
- **Status**: 🔄 NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
- **Purpose**: Collect historical data for verified stocks and process to fact tables
- **Prerequisite**: User has completed stock verification in Step 4

**Process Flow**:
1. **Historical Data Collection**:
   - For each **verified stock**: Retrieve historical price data from Yahoo Finance
   - **Unverified stocks**: Remain in staging table for future processing
   - Store historical data in appropriate tables

2. **Fact Table Processing**:
   - Process **only verified stock transactions** to `FACT_TRANSACTIONS`
   - Update `PORTFOLIO_POSITIONS` with new transaction impacts
   - Mark processed transactions: `STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS.processed_flag = TRUE`

3. **Unverified Stock Handling**:
   - Leave unverified stock transactions in staging (`processed_flag = FALSE`)
   - User can return later to verify these stocks and process them

**Database Transaction Flow**:
```
VERIFIED STOCKS ONLY:
STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS (processed_flag=FALSE, verified stocks) 
↓
Historical Data Collection (Yahoo Finance API)
↓
FACT_TRANSACTIONS (with all dimension keys resolved)
↓  
PORTFOLIO_POSITIONS (updated with new transactions)
↓
STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS (processed_flag=TRUE for verified stocks only)

UNVERIFIED STOCKS:
STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS (processed_flag=FALSE) → Remain for future processing
```

**Position Calculations**:
- Update `PORTFOLIO_POSITIONS` with verified stock transactions only
- Recalculate average cost, current quantity, unrealized P&L
- Handle different transaction types (BUY/SELL/DIVIDEND/SPLIT)

**Error Handling**:
- **Atomic operation**: All verified stock transactions succeed or all rollback
- **Detailed reporting**: Report exactly which transactions succeeded/failed
- **Next import behavior**: Failed and unverified transactions remain in staging for retry

**API**: `POST /api/import/transactions` → Complete import processing with historical data collection
**Files**: `ImportSummary.tsx`, `TransactionImportService.process_verified_transactions()`

### Critical Database Flow Analysis

#### Kimball Star Schema ETL Process (DETAILED)

**Stage 1: Raw Data Staging**
```sql
STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS
├── id (PK, auto-increment)
├── import_batch_id (groups single import session)
├── portfolio_id (FK to target portfolio)  
├── raw_date (TEXT - unparsed date from file)
├── raw_instrument_code (TEXT - ticker from file, e.g., "AFI")
├── raw_transaction_type (TEXT - BUY/SELL/etc from file)
├── raw_quantity (TEXT - unparsed quantity)
├── raw_price (TEXT - unparsed price)
├── raw_currency (TEXT - if provided in file)
├── processed_flag (BOOLEAN - FALSE until moved to fact tables)
├── validation_errors (TEXT - JSON of any validation issues)
└── import_timestamp (audit trail)
```

**CRITICAL FIELD ANALYSIS**:
- **raw_total_value**: REMOVED - can be calculated as quantity * price in fact table
- **All raw fields as TEXT**: Preserves original data for debugging/audit
- **processed_flag**: Prevents double-processing, enables retry logic
- **import_batch_id**: Enables atomic rollback of entire import

**Stage 2: Dimension Population**
```sql
DIM_STOCK (one record per unique instrument across all portfolios)
├── stock_key (PK, auto-increment)
├── instrument_code (UNIQUE - "AFI") 
├── yahoo_symbol (UNIQUE - "AFI.AX" after market assignment)
├── name (NULL until verified via Yahoo Finance)
├── market_key (FK to DIM_YAHOO_MARKET_CODES)
├── currency (NULL until verified via Yahoo Finance)  
├── verification_status ('pending'/'verified'/'failed'/'delisted')
├── sector/industry/exchange (populated during full verification)
└── last_updated (when verification status changed)

PORTFOLIO_STOCK_CONFIG (portfolio-specific stock settings)
├── config_key (PK)
├── portfolio_key (FK) 
├── stock_key (FK)
├── drp_enabled (BOOLEAN - dividend reinvestment plan)
└── notes (TEXT - user notes)
```

**CRITICAL DESIGN DECISIONS**:
- **Global vs Portfolio-Specific Stocks**: DIM_STOCK is global (one "AFI" across all portfolios), PORTFOLIO_STOCK_CONFIG handles portfolio-specific settings
- **Verification Status**: Stock-level, not portfolio-level (once verified, verified for all portfolios)
- **Market Assignment**: Required before moving to fact tables

**Stage 3: Fact Table Population**
```sql  
FACT_TRANSACTIONS (final transaction records)
├── transaction_key (PK)
├── stock_key (FK to DIM_STOCK)
├── portfolio_key (FK to DIM_PORTFOLIO)  
├── transaction_type_key (FK to DIM_TRANSACTION_TYPE)
├── date_key (FK to DIM_DATE - for analytics)
├── transaction_date (actual date)
├── quantity (DECIMAL - parsed and validated)
├── price (DECIMAL - parsed and validated) 
├── total_value (CALCULATED - quantity * price)
├── original_currency/exchange_rate (multi-currency support)
└── total_value_base (converted to portfolio base currency)
```

**Stage 4: Position Calculation**
```sql
PORTFOLIO_POSITIONS (current position snapshots)  
├── position_key (PK)
├── portfolio_key (FK)
├── stock_key (FK)
├── current_quantity (sum of all transactions)
├── average_cost (weighted average of buy transactions)
├── total_cost (current_quantity * average_cost)
├── current_price (latest market price)
├── current_value (current_quantity * current_price)
├── unrealized_pl (current_value - total_cost)
└── last_updated (when position recalculated)
```

#### Database Flow State Transitions

**Question: What happens when stock gets verified?**
```
DIM_STOCK: verification_status = 'pending' → 'verified'
├── name = populated from Yahoo Finance
├── currency = populated from Yahoo Finance  
└── last_updated = current timestamp
Action: Ready for fact table processing
```

**Question: What if stock stays unverified and user wants to skip?**
```
Option 1: Mark as delisted
├── DIM_STOCK: verification_status = 'delisted'
└── Action: Can proceed to fact table processing

Option 2: Skip in current import
├── STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS: processed_flag = remains FALSE
└── Action: Transactions stay in staging for next import attempt
```

**Question: What happens next time user imports?**
```
Existing stocks:
├── Check if already exists in DIM_STOCK by instrument_code
├── If exists: Use existing stock_key for fact table
└── If verification_status = 'failed': Re-attempt verification

New stocks:  
├── Create new DIM_STOCK record with 'pending' status
└── Require market assignment + verification before fact table processing

Duplicate transactions:
├── Compare against existing FACT_TRANSACTIONS
├── Match on: portfolio_key, stock_key, date, quantity, price, transaction_type
└── Skip duplicates, process only new transactions
```

#### Schema Optimization Analysis

**Fields that can be removed/calculated**:
- **raw_total_value**: Remove from STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS (calculate in fact table)
- **total_value in FACT_TRANSACTIONS**: Calculate as quantity * price
- **current_value in PORTFOLIO_POSITIONS**: Calculate as current_quantity * current_price

**Fields that need addition**:
- **DIM_STOCK.last_verified**: Track when verification last attempted
- **DIM_STOCK.verification_attempts**: Count failed verification attempts
- **STG_RAW_TRANSACTIONS.skip_reason**: Why transaction was skipped (duplicate/delisted/failed)

#### Error Handling & Recovery Patterns

**Atomic Import Process**:
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION
├── Validate all raw data in staging
├── Resolve all stock market assignments  
├── Verify all new stocks (or mark delisted)
├── Process all transactions to fact tables
├── Update all portfolio positions
├── Mark raw transactions as processed
└── COMMIT or ROLLBACK (all-or-nothing)
```

**Retry Logic**:
- Failed imports leave data in staging (processed_flag = FALSE)
- Next import can retry same data or add new data
- User can fix market assignments and re-attempt verification
- Duplicate detection prevents double-processing successful transactions

#### Error Fixes Applied
1. **Infinite Re-render in ColumnMapping**: Fixed by creating `isValidMapping()` pure function instead of calling stateful `validateMapping()` in render cycle
2. **TypeScript ReactNode Error**: Fixed by wrapping column values with `String()` conversion
3. **CSS Layout Conflicts**: Removed conflicting padding/max-width from stock-management.css
4. **API Endpoint Duplicates**: Fixed duplicate function definitions in import_transactions.py

---

## 7. RECENT TRANSACTION IMPORT FIXES (July 2025)

### CRITICAL: Flask Blueprint Registration Issues  
- **Problem**: Multiple duplicate endpoint definitions causing Flask AssertionError: "View function mapping is overwriting an existing endpoint function: api.import_transaction"
- **Root Cause**: Used `replace_all=True` on error handler pattern, creating 4 duplicate `import_transactions()` functions at lines 39, 142, 402, 629
- **Symptoms**: Backend completely unable to start, ECONNREFUSED errors in frontend
- **Solution**: Manually rewrote entire `import_transactions.py` file with clean endpoint structure
- **Final Endpoints**: 6 clean routes with no duplicates:
  - `GET /import/template` - CSV template download
  - `GET /import/markets` - Available market codes  
  - `POST /import/assign-markets` - Market assignment + verification
  - `POST /import/analyze` - File structure analysis
  - `POST /import/validate` - Raw data validation
  - `POST /import/transactions` - Final import processing
- **CRITICAL LEARNING**: NEVER use `replace_all=True` on common patterns like error handlers - always target specific unique strings or rewrite manually

### Missing API Endpoints (404 Errors)
- **Problem**: Frontend calling `/api/import/validate` but endpoint didn't exist
- **Cause**: Frontend-backend API contract mismatch during development
- **Solution**: Add missing endpoint with proper request/response handling
- **File**: `import_transactions.py:233-378` - added `/import/validate` endpoint

### Content-Type Mismatch (415 Errors)  
- **Problem**: Frontend sending FormData, backend expecting JSON
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sends file uploads directly to validate endpoint
- **Solution**: Update backend to handle both FormData (file uploads) and JSON (staged data)
- **File**: `import_transactions.py:237-378` - dual handling for different request types
- **Learning**: Always align frontend request format with backend expectations

### Transaction Import UI Flow Restructuring
- **Problem**: Date format selection in wrong component, validation errors not displayed properly
- **Changes Made**:
  - **Moved date format selection** from DataPreview to ColumnMapping component
  - **Fixed backend validation** to return structured results instead of 400 errors
  - **Renamed step** from "Preview & Validate" to "Confirm Transactions"
  - **Updated component flow** to pass dateFormat through entire chain
- **Files**: 
  - `ColumnMapping.tsx:26-37, 273-302` - added date format selection
  - `TransactionImport.tsx:76-77` - renamed step
  - `import_transactions.py:311-322` - fixed validation response structure
- **Learning**: UI flow should match user mental model, not technical implementation convenience

### Backend Validation Response Structure
- **Problem**: Backend returned 400 errors when validation failed, frontend expected structured data
- **Solution**: Always return 200 with structured validation results containing both errors and successes
- **Pattern**: 
  ```python
  return jsonify({
      'success': True,
      'data': {
          'total_rows': total,
          'valid_rows': valid_count, 
          'validation_errors': error_list,
          'validated_transactions': valid_data
      }
  })
  ```
- **Learning**: Validation endpoints should return validation results, not errors

### Frontend Webpack Deprecation Warnings (Non-Critical)
- **Warning 1**: `[DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The 'util._extend' API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.`
- **Warning 2**: `[DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_AFTER_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onAfterSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.`  
- **Warning 3**: `[DEP_WEBPACK_DEV_SERVER_ON_BEFORE_SETUP_MIDDLEWARE] DeprecationWarning: 'onBeforeSetupMiddleware' option is deprecated. Please use the 'setupMiddlewares' option.`
- **Impact**: Non-blocking warnings, application functions normally
- **Cause**: Outdated webpack dev server configuration in React app
- **Status**: Low priority - does not affect functionality
- **Solution**: Update webpack dev server configuration or React Scripts version when convenient

### Error Resolution Summary (July 5, 2025)
**FIXED** ✅:
1. Flask AssertionError (duplicate endpoints) - **BLOCKING** - Backend startup failure
2. ECONNREFUSED (backend connection) - **HIGH** - Frontend unable to connect
3. Missing `/api/import/validate` endpoint - **HIGH** - Step 3 validation failure  
4. Content-Type mismatch (415 errors) - **HIGH** - Frontend/backend API contract

**REMAINING** ⚠️:
1. Webpack deprecation warnings - **LOW** - Non-blocking, cosmetic only

---

## 8. LESSONS LEARNED & DEBUGGING NOTES

### React Performance Issues
- **Infinite Renders**: Caused by calling stateful functions during render cycle
- **Solution**: Create pure validation functions that can be safely called during render
- **File**: ColumnMapping.tsx:87 - `isValidMapping()` function

### CSS Layout Conflicts  
- **Issue**: Component-specific padding/max-width conflicting with page layouts
- **Solution**: Remove layout styles from component CSS, handle layout at page level
- **File**: stock-management.css - removed conflicting styles

### API Endpoint Conflicts
- **Issue**: Duplicate function names when using replace_all operations
- **Solution**: Careful manual cleanup of duplicate endpoints
- **File**: import_transactions.py - cleaned up duplicate functions

### TypeScript ReactNode Issues
- **Issue**: `Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'`
- **Solution**: Explicit type conversion with `String()` wrapper
- **File**: DataPreview.tsx:78 - `{String(column)}` instead of `{column}`

---

## 8. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Complete Phase 2.3**: Modify final import process to use new workflow
2. **Implement Phase 3**: Frontend components for confirmation and market assignment
3. **User Testing**: Validate complete workflow with real transaction files
4. **Error Handling**: Enhance error reporting and recovery mechanisms

### Medium-term Enhancements  
1. **Batch Processing**: Support for very large transaction files
2. **Import Templates**: Save and reuse column mappings for regular imports
3. **Market Intelligence**: Automatic market suggestions based on instrument code patterns
